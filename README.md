# Tic-tac-toe #


I have simulated a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game which will involve accessing shared resources and working with threads. Tic-Tac-Toe is a turn-based game that can be played between two players on a board (N Ã— N matrix). In each turn, a player marks a cell with an X or O and gives the turn to the other player. Having N consecutive diagonal, horizontal or vertical marks of the same type is accepted as a winning state. The first player reaching a winning state wins the game. If there are no cells left to mark on the board and the board is not winning, the result will be a tie. One can assume that square-shaped boards will be used for the game. In order to simulate this game, Linux PThreads will be used as players.
